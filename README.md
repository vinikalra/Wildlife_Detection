# Wildlife_Detection
This project automates the classification of camera trap images using computer vision and machine learning to identify animals and birds. Images are sorted into folders named after the detected species, streamlining data management for wildlife researchers, conservationists, and hobbyists monitoring animals.

# Overview
This project aims to automate the classification and organization of camera trap images featuring animals and birds. The system utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify species captured in the images and then moves the files to folders named after the detected species. This workflow streamlines data management for wildlife researchers, conservationists, and hobbyists who use camera traps for animal monitoring.

# Features
- **Animal Detection and Classification:** Leverages pre-trained deep learning models to classify animals and birds in camera trap images.
- **Automated Folder Organization:** Automatically creates and organizes images into folders named after the detected species.
- **High Accuracy**: Employs state-of-the-art models for high-accuracy classification, including support for common and rare species.
- **User-Friendly:** Minimal configuration requiredâ€”just upload the images and run the program!
- **Customizable:** Add new species or retrain the model with custom datasets for specific environments.

# End Goal
To create a robust, scalable system capable of identifying various species with minimal user intervention. The organized folders will simplify analysis, allow easy sharing of specific species, and contribute to the understanding of biodiversity and animal behavior.

# Technologies
- **Python:** The core language for the project.
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch:** For implementing pre-trained or custom deep learning models.
- **OpenCV:** For image pre-processing and manipulation.
- **scikit-learn:** For additional classification tasks and evaluation.
- **Flask / Streamlit:** (Optional) For building a user interface.

# How It Works
- **Image Input:** Upload camera trap images to the system.
- **Preprocessing:** Images are preprocessed for optimal model performance (resizing, denoising, etc.).
- **Animal Classification:** The model predicts the species in each image.
- **Folder Organization:** Images are moved to folders named after the detected species (e.g., "Deer", "Eagle", "Fox").
- **Review Results:** Optionally review and validate the classification results.
